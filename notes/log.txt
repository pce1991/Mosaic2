DEV LOG

When the file extension is changed to .cpp the makefile automatically uses g++ instead of gcc, but I doubt this is robust (like it might not work on mac).


@TODO: do I suppress warnings? they're super annoying

@TODO: I want to write the compiles as python scripts I think for multiplatform. Or maybe just convert them to bash, duh


@TODO: let the bash file take a custom executable name? 


@TODO: for easy itch building needs to be index.html

@BUG: web builds cant load textures
