DEV LOG

When the file extension is changed to .cpp the makefile automatically uses g++ instead of gcc, but I doubt this is robust (like it might not work on mac).


@TODO: do I suppress warnings? they're super annoying

@TODO: I want to write the compiles as python scripts I think for multiplatform. Or maybe just convert them to bash, duh


@TODO: let the bash file take a custom executable name? 


@TODO: for easy itch building needs to be index.html

@BUG: web builds cant load textures


@TODO: for emmscripten try this to allow more memory -s INITIAL_MEMORY=64MB



- @TODO: for input I guess I can just use Raylib's functions. But I kinda prefer IsPressed(device) to IsDevicePressed...
  It just feels a bit dumb to write wrapper and a mapping between our specific type...

  One reason I like passing devices more is its a better mapping to an action system

  Change it to InputMouseDiscrete or maybe just append all with Input_MouseLeft....

  I'd kinda rather have MouseButton_Left than Input_MouseLeft as an API, but raylib has already defined MouseButton...



- @TODO: UGH so if I want to get VS pdb files we have to build differently, which makes sense obvioussly. So now I need to look into how to compile raylib with MSVC instead of cmake

  @TODO: I think I also need to have a way to make sure that students know they must build raylib at least once right?


@HACK: kinda hacky to not be using events for the mouse, but whatever for right now...
