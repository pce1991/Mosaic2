When the file extension is changed to .cpp the makefile automatically uses g++ instead of gcc, but I doubt this is robust (like it might not work on mac).

Okay going to change it so that bottom left is origin. 

Could we just do:

my_game.cpp
  #include <engine.cpp>
  
  and have the engine predeclare the MyUpdate() and MyInit() functions?
